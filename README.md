# cloud-medic
Python-based solution using machine learning to autonomously detect, diagnose, and resolve issues in cloud environments.

To set up your environment for building a self-healing cloud infrastructure using OpenStack, we'll use DevStack because it's the easiest way to deploy a full OpenStack setup on a single machine for development and testing purposes. I'll guide you through the steps and provide you with useful links to get started.
Step-by-Step Environment Setup

1. Prepare Your System
    
    Operating System: DevStack works best on a Linux distribution like Ubuntu (preferably version 20.04 LTS) or CentOS.
    Make sure your system meets these requirements:
    At least 8 GB of RAM (16 GB or more is recommended).
    At least 100 GB of disk space.
    A multi-core CPU (4 cores or more recommended).
    
2. Install Prerequisites

Before setting up DevStack, install some basic tools and libraries. Open your terminal and run the following commands to update your system and install the required packages:

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y git wget python3 python3-pip
```

1. Download DevStack
    
    Create a new user for DevStack: This is important to ensure DevStack runs in a safe environment:
    
```
sudo useradd -s /bin/bash -d /opt/stack -m stack
sudo passwd stack
sudo usermod -aG sudo stack
```

Switch to the new user:

```
su - stack
```

Download DevStack: Clone the DevStack repository using the following command:


```
git clone <https://opendev.org/openstack/devstack>
cd devstack

```

1. Configure DevStack
    
    Create a configuration file: Create a file called local.conf inside the DevStack directory. This file tells DevStack how to set up your OpenStack environment.
    
    Use this basic configuration for a standard setup:
    
    
```
nano local.conf
```

Add the following lines to the local.conf file:

```
[[local|localrc]]
ADMIN_PASSWORD=secret
DATABASE_PASSWORD=$ADMIN_PASSWORD
RABBIT_PASSWORD=$ADMIN_PASSWORD
SERVICE_PASSWORD=$ADMIN_PASSWORD
HOST_IP=127.0.0.1.
```

Save the file and exit the editor

1. Install DevStack

Run the installation script:

```
./stack.sh
```

This process may take some time as DevStack installs all necessary components of OpenStack. Once it's done, you'll see a message indicating that the installation was successful, along with URLs to access the OpenStack dashboard.
6. Access the OpenStack Dashboard

```
Open your web browser and go to the URL:

arduino

```

http://<your-ip-address>/dashboard

If you're working on a local machine, it might be:

arduino

```
<http://127.0.0.1/dashboard>

Log in with the following credentials:
    Username: admin
    Password: The password you set in the local.conf file (secret in our example).

```

Let's break down the project into a simple, easy-to-follow guide. Imagine you're going on a step-by-step adventure to build a self-healing cloud system using OpenStack, which means it can fix itself when something goes wrong, like a superhero!

### The Adventure Map: Building a Self-Healing Cloud with OpenStack

### **Step 1: Set Up the Playground (Your OpenStack Environment)**

- **Goal**: Create a place where you can play around with OpenStack and its tools.
- **Tools You'll Use**: DevStack (to set up OpenStack quickly).
- **What to Do**:
    1. Set up **DevStack** on your computer. Think of it like building a sandbox where you can practice without messing things up.
    2. Make sure you have OpenStack services ready: Nova (for virtual machines), Heat (for automation), Monasca (for monitoring), and Ceilometer (for tracking data).

### **Step 2: Collect Cool Information (Making the Dataset)**

- **Goal**: Gather data from the VMs that tell you when they are happy and when they’re feeling sick.
- **Tools You'll Use**: Ceilometer (for collecting data), Monasca (for watching VMs).
- **What to Do**:
    1. Turn on Ceilometer and Monasca to start collecting data about your VMs.
    2. Collect information like how much memory and CPU they’re using, disk space, and any errors they might have.
    3. Label the data: When the VM is working well, mark it as "Healthy." When it’s not doing well, mark it as "Failure."

### **Step 3: Teach the Computer to Spot Trouble (Building the Model)**

- **Goal**: Create a smart program that can look at the data and tell you when a VM is about to have problems.
- **Tools You'll Use**: Machine learning tools like Scikit-Learn or TensorFlow.
- **What to Do**:
    1. Use the data you collected and clean it up (like organizing your toy box).
    2. Train a machine learning model to tell you if a VM is healthy or sick using the data.
    3. Test the model to make sure it’s good at spotting trouble.

### **Step 4: Set Up the Alarm System (Making the System Self-Healing)**

- **Goal**: Make your system smart so it can fix itself when something goes wrong.
- **Tools You'll Use**: Heat (for automatic actions), Mistral (for workflows), and Aodh (for alarms).
- **What to Do**:
    1. Set up an alarm with Aodh that goes off when the model predicts a problem.
    2. Use Heat and Mistral to create a plan for what to do when the alarm goes off. For example, restart the VM or create a new one.
    3. Make sure the plan runs automatically whenever your model spots trouble.

### **Step 5: Test and Play (Simulate Problems and Watch the System Fix Itself)**

- **Goal**: See if your superhero system can save the day when VMs are in trouble.
- **What to Do**:
    1. Create some pretend problems for your VMs (like making them work too hard or stopping them from running smoothly).
    2. Watch how your model predicts these problems.
    3. Check if your system's plan kicks in to fix the VM automatically.

### **Step 6: Learn from Mistakes and Level Up (Improve Your Model)**

- **Goal**: Make your self-healing system even smarter over time.
- **What to Do**:
    1. Look at the times your system missed a problem or gave a false alarm.
    2. Make your model better by training it with more data.
    3. Keep testing and improving until your system is super smart and quick at fixing itself.

### Tools You'll Be Using

- **DevStack**: Your playground where you build everything.
- **Ceilometer and Monasca**: The eyes that watch how well your VMs are doing.
- **Scikit-Learn or TensorFlow**: The brain that learns to spot problems.
- **Heat, Mistral, and Aodh**: The hands that fix the VMs when they’re in trouble.
- **Grafana**: A dashboard to see how well your VMs are doing (like a video game scoreboard).

### Expected Superpowers of Your System

- **It watches VMs all the time and learns when they’re in trouble.**
- **It sounds an alarm and starts fixing the problem without you touching anything.**
- **It keeps getting smarter the more it sees problems.**

And there you have it! This is your step-by-step adventure to create a superhero cloud system using OpenStack. Each step builds on the last one, and before you know it, your system will be fixing itself whenever it senses trouble.
